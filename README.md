Tile Map Adventure
BY Alice

OVERVIEW OF GAME
Tile Map Adventure" is an exploration game. The game background is from the jungle. Players are born in randomly generated mazes. Each maze and challenge are arranged on a grid-based tile map. The core mechanism is to collect key items and find the exit within the specified time. The central theme of the game is to find the door of the maze through obstacles and reasoning. The player's journey includes both discovery and exploration of the surrounding environment, as well as through problem solving and thinking of strategies. Aesthetically, "Tile Map Adventure" refers to classic adventure games, hoping to use retro pixel art to create a unique background, and use randomly refreshed maps to give players a sense of mystery. Tile Map Adventure is designed to appeal to both nostalgic players and new players looking for an immersive puzzle adventure. 

INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS
Regarding the contribution parts, since I completed it independently, I would like to briefly explain my thinking process about this game. The goal at the beginning was to make a game that could be continuously passed. The entire game should contain a complete storyline, and players would learn some clues through changes in terrain and weather during the process. But when I started creating on my own, there were a lot of things I didnâ€™t know where to look for, and my lack of programming knowledge meant that my initial ideas had to be reduced a lot. Finally, I simplified it a bit, hoping to make it a retro and original pixel game.

THEMES
The tone of the game is one of adventure and curiosity, with a hint of nostalgia, inviting players to embark on a journey that challenges their problem-solving skills.

GAME DESIGN
The design rules of this game are that players use the arrow keys to control hearts to move in the jungle, and gain points by eating yellow dots. The prescribed clearance time is 5 minutes. Players need to find randomly generated gates within the prescribed time. There are a total of Three, as long as they find the door, they can escape from the maze.

Mechanism that has not yet been implemented (interested in exploring in the future)
1. Multi-layered puzzles: Puzzles that span multiple maps or require actions in different areas to solve, reflecting the interconnectedness of the game world.
2. Cooperative elements: multuple players
3. Adaptive artificial intelligence: Introducing non-player characters (NPCs) with adaptive artificial intelligence, which can help or hinder player progress, adding dynamic interactions and challenges.
4. The weather and terrain change with the level

AESTHETIC
aesthetic approach
Tile Map Adventure aims to be reminiscent of classic adventure and puzzle games of the past through its use of pixel style, while incorporating contemporary design principles. And placing the view at the center of the player allows players to have a richer dynamic gaming experience. 

Is there anything else you would like to add?
If I had more time, resources, and teammates, I would expand Tile Map Adventure by adding more levels, each with its own unique theme and set of puzzles. Another goal is to refine the storyline and give players a greater impact on the world and its outcomes. I also considered a multiplayer component where players could cooperate or compete to solve puzzles. Further development will benefit from a deeper understanding of the technology, allowing players to have features such as dynamic lighting, weather effects and more complex puzzle mechanics.
